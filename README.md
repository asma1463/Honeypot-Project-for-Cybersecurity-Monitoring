This repository contains a honeypot-based cybersecurity project designed to simulate vulnerable systems and monitor malicious activities. The project uses synthetic data generation and machine learning techniques to analyze attack patterns, helping in understanding attacker behavior. It demonstrates how honeypots can be used as an effective defensive mechanism for threat detection and cybersecurity research.

Key Highlights:
Honeypot environment simulation
Synthetic attack data generation
Detection and analysis of suspicious activities
Use of machine learning for attack pattern insights
Practical application in cybersecurity monitoring
